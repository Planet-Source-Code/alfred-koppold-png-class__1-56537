With the class LoadPNG.cls you can simple load PNG-Graphics.
Included is Alphablending and transparence.
A sinple example is in "Simple PNG Example".
Also included are my old classes to read TGA and PCX-Pictures
and a new Class to read some TIF-files (only for testing).
The Class can read uncompressed and RLE-compressed tif-files (If you had an
procedure to read other compressed tif-files please send it to me).

The inflate-procedure is from Marco v/d Berg (from PSC). Some pieces of code
i get from the internet (PSC, activevb).

The CRC-Routines (one in pure VB, one in ASM) i write out - then the class is faster.

If someone can make the prog better and faster (ASM...), find a bug,
had Descriptions from other Graphicformats (CDR...) or had
Decompresssubs (for TIF see in TestTiff) please send it to me.
